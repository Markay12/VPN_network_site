## What is a VPN?
A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, giving privacy to people online. These used to only be used in business settings where business and government would secure their data. 

Without a VPN you may be at risk for hacking or stolen data.   
Having a VPN is **essential** to keep your location and identity hidden.

An example of this with https://www.facebook.com/

* First, you type in a domain name that is a nickname for that sites IP address.
	* This makes it easier than using a ton of numbers. 
	* Every device using the internet has an IP address specifying the location and identity of that certain device including your computer. 

When looking up a website you request data from that server and in response, they send you back what you requested. However, this action also comes with you sending this server your information request including information about you and your computer.

Therefore, if a hacker were to gain access to this data, they would learn a lot of information about you.

When on a local area network (LAN), such as a Starbucks location, someone can access the information that you are sending when signing into **any** application. 

When using a VPN this protects the user from the targeting and stolen information by encrypting this data.  
Not only does this VPN protect you from hackers stealing your information, it protects you from sending this information directly to the people you are requesting information from

## You and the Provider

When requesting information from a provider your VPN will encrypt your data. This is in case someone gets a hold of your data; they will not be able to read it.  
With a VPN, your data goes to a server that then requests information from your desired location. This has the VPN work as sort of a middleman. But why is this important?...


This *middleman* can also allow the user to be at ‘different’ locations, depending on which VPN server they connect to. The main issue here may be latency as if you are connecting to Germany from the United States that would take some time.  

Changing your location can allow you to access restricted content in your current location as well as getting better prices for hotels and other services.

## Privacy
Privacy becomes an interesting topic when discussing its power and the government. When using a VPN your data only reaches the VPN server. Therefore, the data that you sent would not be easily accessed by someone trying to get a hold of it (i.e., Government agencies).

VPN’s also do not hold log files. This means that they do not keep track of the sites that you have visited. Therefore, if the government were to ask what sites you have visited, the information would not be available.

* Change location 

* Encrypt Data
* Ensure Privacy
